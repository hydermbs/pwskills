        "Where file_name is the name of the file and mode is an optional parameter that specifies the mode in which the file is opened.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several modes of opening a file in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "'r' (Read Only): This is the default mode. In this mode, the file is opened in read-only mode, and you can only read the file, not write to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "'w' (Write Only): In this mode, the file is opened in write mode, and you can write to the file, but you cannot read from it. If the file exists, its contents are truncated, otherwise, a new file with the same name is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "'a' (Append Only): In this mode, the file is opened in append mode, and you can write to the file, but you cannot read from it. The new data is appended to the end of the file, so it won't overwrite the existing data. If the file does not exist, a new file with the same name is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "'x' (Exclusive Creation): In this mode, the file is opened for exclusive creation. If the file exists, the open() function raises a FileExistsError exception. This mode is used to avoid the accidental creation of a file with the same name as an existing file.\n",
        "\n",
        "'b' (Binary Mode): In this mode, the file is opened in binary mode, and you can read or write binary data. You can combine 'b' with other modes to open the file in binary mode, for example 'wb' for write-only binary mode, and 'rb' for read-only binary mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "'t' (Text Mode): In this mode, the file is opened in text mode, and you can read or write text data. You can combine 't' with other modes to open the file in text mode, for example 'wt' for write-only text mode, and 'rt' for read-only text mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: If you don't specify the mode when opening a file, Python opens it in read-only mode by default.\n"
