    "Abstraction: Hiding the internal details and exposing only the necessary information to the outside world. This allows objects to be treated as a single entity rather than a collection of data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Wrapping data and behavior within an object, making it a self-contained unit. This protects the internal state of the object from being modified by external forces, ensuring the integrity and consistency of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: The ability to create new classes based on existing classes, inheriting their properties and behavior. This allows new classes to be created with added or modified features, while avoiding redundant code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: The ability to treat objects of different classes in a similar manner, by defining a common interface. This allows objects to be treated as objects of the base class, even though they may be instances of derived classes. This is useful in writing generic algorithms that can work with objects of different types, without having to know the exact type of the object."
