        "Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",

        "#**Ans**\n",
        "In Python, custom exceptions are defined as classes that inherit from the built-in Exception class or one of its subclasses. The reason we use the Exception class as the base class for custom exceptions is because it provides a standard interface for raising and handling exceptions in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Exception class provides a number of useful methods and attributes for working with exceptions, such as __str__ for creating a string representation of the exception, args for accessing the exception arguments, and with_traceback for attaching a traceback to the exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "By inheriting from the Exception class, custom exceptions can take advantage of these methods and attributes, and be treated in the same way as built-in exceptions in Python. For example, we can catch custom exceptions using a try/except block, just as we would catch built-in exceptions like ValueError or TypeError.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, using the Exception class as the base class for custom exceptions also ensures that the exception hierarchy is well-defined and follows best practices. This makes it easier for developers to understand and work with custom exceptions, and can help avoid confusion and errors in the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, we use the Exception class as the base class for custom exceptions in Python because it provides a standard interface for working with exceptions, and ensures that the exception hierarchy is well-defined and follows best practices."
